# About Me

## Self Description

Currently residing in Chongqing, China, with the online alias *Justin3go*, I am an Indie Hacker / AI Maker / Full Stacker. A favorite saying of mine is: "Success lies in execution, and the value is in perseverance."

I am a T-shaped front-end developer who is committed to deepening my expertise in the technical field, focusing on AI and independent development. I enjoy working with Vue.js and Nest.js, and I have some knowledge of Python, search engines, NLP, Web3, and back-end development.

Although I am a front-end engineer, I am more of a computer enthusiast. I often experiment with productivity tools, try out various software and websites, and I love open source, sharing, exploring, and creating value with code.
