# He

<!--Yusuol-->
He is all that was, all that is, and all that ever will be—the beginning and the end, the totality of time and space, of you and me, of him, her, it—and Him. He may exist, or not; may have perished long ago or not yet been born; may know His own essence, or remain forever unaware. I pondered until my head throbbed with pain, yet could not comprehend. No one can. And still, that does not stop us from living. The world is vast; life, vaster still—and we, infinitesimal. To live is nothing more than wagering the small against the great, using our insignificance to perceive, transform, and create the immensity of the world and of life. You might think it’s beyond our reach, but it is what we have done, are doing, and must continue to do.

You woke and checked the time—12:04 AM. You’d barely slept an hour, and it was nothing like you imagined. You thought morning had already come. You didn’t know who she was. She sat upon a stone, speaking of Him. You believed it was Him she spoke of—but perhaps it wasn’t. You didn’t know whether she was searching for some ultimate truth or merely murmuring in post-heartbreak despair. It didn’t matter. What mattered was this: you could no longer sleep.

Who was she, then? You had no answer—but strangely, you did. She was your dream, your invention, your romantic illusion.

What did it matter who she was? Even if the skies fell and dragons cried out, it still would not justify losing your sleep. But sleep would not come. You longed to hear her voice again. The words she had spoken were already slipping from memory. You scrambled to record them on your phone, yet nothing you typed seemed complete—something essential was missing.

What was missing? Perhaps just one more look at her would reveal it—but she was already gone. You had to see her again. So you fought desperately to sleep. But the harder you fought, the farther sleep fled. Only then did you realize: sleep cannot be forced.

So you gave up the struggle, laid still, and emptied your mind. You’d once heard that when sleep evades you, do not toss and turn. Just lie quietly, eyes closed—rest, even if only lightly.

Why must you see her again? To understand Him. But could you not seek understanding on your own? Could you not look upon Him directly? No—you’d heard such vision would drive one mad. Then imagine? Even that failed you. Only through her could you hope to understand—and she had vanished.

Was there a way to bring her back? And if she returned, how would you find Him through her? You thought and thought… until, somewhere in your thoughts, you fell asleep. The vision shifted. Once again, you stood before the stone. She was there, sitting just as before.

"Come," she said. "I know what you feel. Come to me—I will help you understand Him."

She rose as she spoke, clad only in a white robe—silken, perhaps—pure as an angel’s grace. You stared at her, perfect and untainted. You wanted to flee, but your feet would not obey. Finally, you stepped forward. She came to meet you. There, before the stone, the two of you united in love. Power surged through your being, and she told you: seize this moment—only then could you see Him.

And you did. In that instant, you beheld the birth of heavens and earth, the genesis of all things—a void, an abstraction, a nameless concept beyond form or understanding. Then all was gone. You awoke. She was no longer there.

You do not know if she was a nun—but she was undoubtedly performing a nun’s sacred task: guiding a soul to glimpse God. You do not believe in God, and so you did not see Him. What you saw… was the beginning of all matter.
