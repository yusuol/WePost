### [Miniature World](https://x.com/op7418/status/1909447949211558281)

> An isometric 3D illustration in a minimalist style, depicting a hidden, extraordinarily serene stress-relief oasis—a Japanese Zen garden—inside an old beige computer tower case (typical late 1990s/early 2000s office style, ATX structure).
> 
> External Features: The tower case is classic beige or pale yellow plastic, possibly with a floppy drive slot, CD drive tray, dust-covered ventilation grilles, round power button, and maybe a faded "Property of..." asset tag on the side. Overall, it presents the appearance of a forgotten, vintage piece of office equipment.
> 
> Internal Scene: The open side panel of the tower case (or the internal space with the panel removed) is converted into a miniature Zen garden. Most of the space is covered with meticulously raked fine white sand, with mini dark rocks (symbolizing islands) strategically placed among them. A small patch of lush green moss might cover a "rock" corner. There could also be a tiny Tsukubai (Shishi-odoshi) device crafted ingeniously from fine copper wires and electronic components, standing serenely.
> 
> Figure: A mini "worker bee" figure, dressed in a wrinkled shirt, perhaps with a loosely tied tie, sits calmly in a corner of the sand garden, holding an extremely tiny wooden rake, gazing intently at the sand patterns, seemingly engaged in a meditative mental exercise.
> 
> Details and Atmosphere: Light beams mainly enter through the top ventilation of the case or from the side slits, projecting clear yet soft shadows on the sand and rocks. The light might simulate the cold office fluorescent lighting, but in the garden area, it's tempered by the interior atmosphere to be softer and more tranquil. The scene colors primarily consist of the white sand, dark gray rocks, green moss, and the natural colors of the metal/plastic components in the tower background, forming an elegant, understated contrast, creating an ultimate sense of peace, focus, and escape from reality.
> 
> Overall Feel: With a slight 3D texture and some plasticity, it feels like a warm secret hidden beneath the cold facade of technology, akin to a finely crafted desktop diorama. This scene, inside a computer tower that symbolizes work stress and constraints, builds a Zen space representing inner peace and mental freedom, forming a strong visual and emotional contrast. Ideal for modern city dwellers seeking a moment of tranquility, office workers, miniature model and Japanese aesthetic enthusiasts, and those who appreciate digital artwork exploring the relationship between work, life, and the inner world.

### Low Poly Style

> `A minimalist 3D island floating in space, low-poly design with pastel colors.`

### [Tourism Visual Notes](https://x.com/op7418/status/1907725315025330245)

> Please generate an image simulating a hand-written visual note on slightly textured paper (such as cream or light brown) about a tourist location. The image should present a travel journal/collage style, containing the following elements:
> 
> - Handwritten in a font that resembles blue or brown ink, including the tourist location's name, geographic location, best visiting season, and one or two catchy slogans or introductions.
> - An introduction to several major attractions or features, using numbered lists or bullet points (e.g., list 2-3 specific attractions like "strange rock formations," "ancient legends," "unique plants"), with brief handwritten annotations.
> - Highlight or point out particularly recommended spots or activities with red ink or other bright colors (e.g., list 1-2 recommendations).
> - Interspersed with simple, doodle-style illustrations related to the features of the tourist location (e.g., think of 1-2 representative drawings based on features like mountain profiles, characteristic plants or animals, iconic buildings, etc.)
> 
> Decorated with a few small photos of the location, appearing pasted on from a slightly retro style or Polaroid look. The overall feel should resemble a vividly crafted, engaging personal guide from an enthusiastic tour guide or an experienced traveler.

### [Hand-Drawn Highlight Information Card](https://x.com/dotey/status/1907903480678985784)

> Create a hand-drawn style infographic card, ratio 9:16 vertical. The card should have a distinctive theme, with a paper-textured cream or off-white background, embodying a simple, friendly hand-drawn aesthetic. At the top, use prominent red and black contrasting bold script title to capture the visual focus. Text content should adopt Chinese cursive script, with an overall layout divided into 2 to 4 clear sections, each expressing core points in brief, concise Chinese phrases. The script should maintain fluent rhyme, ensuring readability while presenting artistic charm. Sprinkle simple, interesting hand-drawn illustrations or symbols, e.g., figures or symbolic icons, to enhance visual appeal, provoking readers' thoughts and resonance. Maintain balance in the layout, leave ample blank space to ensure the overall design is clean, easily readable and comprehensible.
> 
> `<h1><span style="color:red">「Cognition」</span> determines the upper limit <span style="color:red">「Circle」</span> determines the opportunity</h1> - You cannot earn money beyond your 「Cognition」, - Nor encounter opportunities beyond your 「Circle」.`

### Innsmouth Shadow Notes

> Generate an image with an aspect ratio of 2:3 and use English for the text within the image. This image is to simulate a personal notes page created by a reader for the novel The Shadow over Innsmouth. Style: Collage/scrapbook aesthetic, hand-drawn elements mixed with pasted items on a textured paper background (e.g., like a Moleskine notebook or vellum). Please include the following elements: HANDWRITTEN QUOTES: A few classic or impactful English sentences from a novel, written in a clear but handwritten font with a personal touch. CHARACTER DRAWINGS: Simple doodle-style headshots of 2-3 main characters, not necessarily very realistic, but more like quick impressionistic captures. CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS DIAGRAM: Arrows drawn between the character doodles with short handwritten English text labels describing their relationships (e.g., "Siblings", "Lovers", "Mentor & Student", "Rivals"). PASTED CORNER OF PAGE: A small, realistic-looking piece that simulates a corner torn or cut from an actual novel page (on which some printed English text can be seen) that looks like it was taped or glued to the notes page. (Optional) Annotations: Possibly small handwritten notes or question marks next to quotes or characters. Layout: Elements should be arranged organically, perhaps overlapping slightly, to create the feel of a frequently used personal journal page. OVERALL FEEL: Thought-provoking, analytical, personal, visually appealing.
