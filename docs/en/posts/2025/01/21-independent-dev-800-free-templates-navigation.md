# I independently developed a directory with over 800 free templates.

> ✨Article Summary (AI Generated)

<!-- DESC SEP -->

I am pleased to introduce the website I developed, [template0.com](https://template0.com/), a directory site dedicated to collecting high-quality free templates. As the founder, I firmly believe that success often begins with a good template rather than starting from scratch. This belief is reflected in the site's name: "template" comes before "0," and the "0" symbolizes that all templates are free ($0).

This project addresses three main pain points:
- High-quality free templates are difficult to discover and lack sufficient exposure.
- Users find it challenging to quickly locate free templates that meet their needs.
- There is a lack of a platform for exploring and enhancing website aesthetics.

The website offers a variety of features, including:
- A categorized filtering system
- Curated collection displays
- Blog content output
- Free template submissions
- Personal collection functionality

Currently, the site has 4,000 monthly active users and 14,000 page views, with steady growth. We maintain operations through sponsorships, ensuring that all content remains free for users. We welcome everyone to explore and collect their favorite templates, and creators are encouraged to submit their own works!

## Site Introduction

[template0.com](https://template0.com/) is a directory website aimed at collecting high-quality free templates available on the Internet, including landing pages, blogs, portfolios, ecommerce, and admin dashboards, among others.

Why is it called template0? It has two meanings:

1. I firmly believe that success begins with a template, not from scratch. The "template" comes before "0", representing this meaning.
2. You can also consider 0 as $0, meaning all the templates here are free of charge.

Why create such a website? To put it simply, there are three purposes:

1. High-quality free templates are often forgotten in some corner. This is a showcase site for free templates.

- When searching keywords on Google, free templates are often overshadowed by paid template results.
- Because the templates are free, many creators don't invest much effort in promotion, making it difficult for quality templates to gain visibility.
- Many free templates created by people do not have a specific place for display. Template0 is such a directory website that showcases creators' works and provides a platform for explorers to discover them.

2. Desired free templates are hard to find.

- Many templates lack detailed information on purpose, tech stack, or preview images, making it difficult for those seeking templates to find what they need.
- Many free templates require registration to download. These have been filtered out.
- All templates go through a basic screening to ensure good appearance and include a live demo.

3. Aesthetic sense stems from exploration.

- This is another reason for creating this site: to encourage exploration and experiencing others' websites, thus enhancing one's aesthetic sense.
- All website content is manually collected or user-submitted, rather than being scraped in large quantities by web crawlers.
- I will continually keep an eye on industry trends, collecting high-quality free templates as I encounter them. The site's content is continuously updated.

There is also a sponsor carousel module at the top, and at the bottom, there are email subscription and footer modules similar to those on the homepage.

### Blog Page

In addition, to continuously produce content and increase search engine exposure, Template0 also includes a Blog page. Of course, there is currently limited blog content, but more will be gradually added in the future.

### Price Page

First, let me state that all the content on this website is free, whether it's templates or submitting your own free templates. The website is maintained solely through sponsorship:

- To avoid excessive disturbance to users, there are only eight sponsorship slots.
- Sponsors are ranked by the amount of sponsorship (up to $99), and then by the earliest sponsorship time. The top 8 are displayed.

### Submit Page

Here, you can submit your free templates for free to gain exposure and traffic. Last month, the site's traffic was 4k UV and 14k PV, and it is continuously growing!

template0.com is just a directory site and will not host any preview content or source code. Links will lead to your own website, providing traffic and SEO benefits to you.

template0.com only accepts templates that are free to use, come with a live demo, and have a good appearance. If you have free templates in template0.com, you can copy the badge below and place it anywhere in your template demo or repository.

```html
<a href="https://template0.com/item/XXX" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://img.template0.com/template-$0-created-for-fun-v1.svg" alt="Template $0 - Created for Fun" style="height: 50px" />
</a>
```

About featured template Featured template has no commercial content and is purely based on personal preference of the site owner, with a focus on the following points:

1. Whether the template code is well-structured, well-documented, and easy to modify.
2. Whether the appearance is clean, modern, and sleek.
3. Whether the overall appearance of the template is a relatively unique design, such as a terminal style.

Generally, meeting any of these criteria will lead to being featured.

After submission, it will undergo a review process, which I usually complete and publish within three days. This is to prevent non-free content and other inappropriate content from appearing on the site, as we have previously received NSFW submissions.

Meanwhile, you can view and manage your submitted projects on the Dashboard page.
### Favorites

You can freely explore your favorite templates here, click to save them on the details page, and find your private collection list on the Dashboard page, making it easy to quickly locate them for future use!
