# I Developed a Daily Product Picks from Hacker News

> âœ¨Article Summary (AI Generated)

<!-- DESC SEP -->

I developed a daily curated platform focused on the "Show HN" section of Hacker News. As an automated content aggregation website, it automatically fetches high-quality posts with scores above 3 from Hacker News every morning at 8:00 AM. The system uses DeepSeek API to intelligently summarize content, categorize projects, and generate easy-to-read Markdown format reports.

A standout feature of the platform is its **multi-language translation** support, automatically converting content into 9 languages including Chinese, making these quality contents easily accessible to users worldwide. Additionally, through its **intelligent categorization system**, users can quickly locate projects in their areas of interest, such as developer tools, productivity tools, and more.

> This is a platform that helps users efficiently access quality project information from Hacker News, whether they're looking for inspiration or discovering great products.

## Introduction

As a primary source of information for many channels, Hacker News sees many excellent projects being launched daily, making it essential to keep track of it regularly.

That's why I created this website, aiming to become an efficient curated platform for Show HN content, helping users quickly understand new projects worth following each day. Through automated content collection, categorization, and multi-language translation, users worldwide can easily access these quality contents.

The content here is generated by an automated script that fetches "Show HN" posts with scores above 3 from Hacker News every morning at 8:00 AM, using DeepSeek API to summarize them into daily Markdown format digests.

The code won't be open-sourced as it was quickly put together in Cursor, and I haven't reviewed it much myself. The functionality is implemented though.
